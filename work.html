            At the University of Toronto, I am a student at the Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering, pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in <a href="https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/what-is-engsci/#:~:text=Engineering%20science%20is%20an%20interdisciplinary,scientific%2C%20engineering%20and%20arts%20principles." target="_blank">Engineering Science</a>
            with a specialization in <a href="https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/majors/energy-systems-engineering/" target="_blank">Energy Systems</a>. To complement this, I am also pursuing a minor in <a href="https://undergrad.engineering.utoronto.ca/academics-registration/minors-certificates/undergraduate-engineering-minors/engineering-business-minor/" target="_blank"> Engineering Business</a>.

            The Engineering Science program is a rigorous one where students take a breadth of courses in varying fields of STEM. These courses include Calculus, Computer Science, Engineering Design, Quantum Physics, Statistics, Electromagnetism, and more.
            These are taken in the first two years of the program to give us exposure to different fields of engineering before we choose one of eight specialized majors for our final two years of study.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            It is in these two years where I will specialize in Energy Systems, learning about the impact of our energy consumption methods and various aspects of thermodynamics, sustainability, and electrical systems.
            It can be thought of as a combination of Mechanical, Chemical, and Electrical Engineering.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            In the Energy Systems specialization, I have taken courses in Thermodynamics, Power Systems, Electric Drives, Control Theory, and Fuel Cells, among others. These have helped me develop an understanding of the technology around me, providing me with a fundamental
            skillset to interpret problems and develop solutions. These are transferrable skills that I am taking with me during my <a href="https://engineeringcareers.utoronto.ca/work-experience-programs/professional-experience-year-co-op-program-pey-co-op/" target="_blank">PEY</a> internship at AMD.

        <p>
            At UTHT, I am an engineer on the Levitation-Propulsion and Stability System subteams. My work involves designing and analyzing the various components that comprise the  systems to ensure proper functionality.
            To design the parts, I use SolidWorks 2020, an industry leading CAD program.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Structural analysis of the parts is done using the Finite Element Method on ANSYS Mechanical. Here, the part geometry is imported from SolidWorks, material properties are defined, and then a mesh is created. Once the external forces, loads,
            and supports are defined, the program can begin solving. The time this takes depends on the size and complexity of the geometry. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            In addition to structural analysis of Levitation-Propulsion and Stability components, I am also working with the Infrastructure team to design columns for a Hyperloop system development. Here, I am less concerned with
            designing, and more concerned with analyzing. The columns I test are analogues to bridge columns, large pillars of concrete and wood meant to withstand extremely high loads. My goal is to make sure they do, without failure.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Recently, I have been learning electromegnetic simulations, as this will be needed for the next phase of our Hyperloop development. Nonlinearities, Dynamics, and Fluids modelling are also high on the priority list and I look forward to applying 
            these to our design process.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Below are pictures of some designs that I have tested for Levitation-Propulsion, Stability, and Infrastructure. You can also find a <a href="Hyperloop_Sustainability.pdf" target="_blank">document</a> on sustainability I wrote for my Engineering and Society course where I discuss Hyperloop.

            At UTQC, I am the Logistics and Marketing Lead. My responsibilities include managing and designing the website that I have linked above (and <a href="https://www.uoftquantum.ca/" target="_blank">here</a> for your convenience)
            along with reaching out to researchers and companies in the quantum computing field. We are planning a seminar in the coming months, and I have been responsible for finding speakers who are interested in participating.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Quantum information is something that I have recently become interested in, and when I got the opportunity to join UTQC as a Lead, I knew to seize it. This largely unexplored field has a lot of potential in how we approach large scale computations
            in the future and I urge you to explore our website to gain some exposure and maybe even learn something new.
